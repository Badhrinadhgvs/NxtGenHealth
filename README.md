## 📍 Overview

<code>Nowadays Many of the companies check a person's health risks based on one parameter but here we will take various parameters like Bp, Height, Weight, etc and then we will use Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict the person' health as No risk, Low risk, and High risk and based on the type of risk we will provide recommendations like Health tips, Specialist recommendations, etc and at last we will provide a report in the form of pdf which is downloadable.</code>

---
## 🎯 Objective
<code>Develop a comprehensive health risk prediction system that evaluates an individual’s health based on multiple parameters such as blood pressure (BP), height, weight, and other relevant metrics. The system will use machine learning algorithms to classify health risks into three categories: No Risk, Low Risk, and High Risk. Based on the risk category, personalized recommendations will be provided, including health tips and specialist consultations. Finally, a detailed report will be generated in PDF format for download.</code>


## 👾 Features

<code>> Predictive Health Alerts</code>
<code>> Human Computer Interraction(HCI)</code>
<code>> Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology</code>
<code>> Recommendations and Report generation</code>
